      <h3>About Dean Insurance Agency</h3>
      <h5>Meet Deborah Turner</h5>
      <img src="images/debbie.jpg" alt="" class='debbie'>
      <p>
        It's likely that the seed to become a champion for man's best friend was planted in Deborah Turner years ago when, as a child, she witnessed an act of animal abuse yes was powerless to stop it. Fast forward to today, when Debbie has parlayed her love of dogs, a deep understanding of their behavior, and a strong background in insurance to replace coverage that is being removed from homeowners and rental policies with Canine Liability Insurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        While doing research for a paper for the prestigious Society of Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters (aka CPCU), it occurred to her that there is a gross misunderstanding by the insurance industry as to which dogs to insure for dog bite liability. Finding that breed is only one small part in the process, Debbie looked at developing a rating modality that incorporates identifiable factors as to the likelehood a dog will bite regardless of the breed. The most often question asked is will she insure one of the so-called dangerous breeds, and the answer is yes! The Canine Liability Policy is designed for any and ALL Breeds of dogs.
      </p>
      <h5>Dean Insurance Agency</h5>
      <p>
        Debbie developed the Canine Liability Policy offering protection for dog owners in the event their dog(s) injures a person or another animal. Each dog is individually underwritten examining those characteristics that play a part in the propensity for dog biting. Policy limits range from $25,000 - $300,000. Debbie also has the ability to include additional insureds if required. In stark contrast to other programs, Canine Liablility insurance does not exclude any particular breed of dog; this approach in central to Debbie's unique understanding of dog behavior that has turned underwriting this risk on its floppy ear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program initiallly began in 2012 available in a limited number of stats. Today Canine Liability coverage is available in all states execpt Alaska. The policy has also been redesigned to offer much broader coverage with no deductible. You can request a quote by filling out an online application and emailling it to <a href="mailto:dturner@deaninsuraceai.com">dturner@deaninsuraceai.com</a>, or by completing the lead form on this page for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The policy was originally sold through a subsidiary of her agency Federation of Insured Dog Owners aka F.I.D.O. and is now sold through Debbie's agency, Dean Insurance Agency, Inc. Dean Insurance was established in 1994 and provides a broad range of insurance products and services to personal and business customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Debbie has recentyl been nominated a finalist for Woman of the Year in the Pet Industy Network.
